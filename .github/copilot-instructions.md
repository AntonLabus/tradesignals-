This is a Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project for a Forex & Crypto trading signals dashboard. Follow the ``app/`` directory convention to add route components in `src/app`:
- `page.tsx` for main pages
- `(pair)/page.tsx` for dynamic routes under `/signals`
Ensure mobile-responsive design, light/dark mode toggle, and integration with external APIs (Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko, NewsAPI).
